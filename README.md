# Tic-Tac-Toe
A Python application that allows users to play games of Tic-Tac-Toe against a minimax-based artificial intelligence.

	# How to use:
	- In terminal, navigate to the project folder and run the application using the command line command:
		python __init__.py 
	- Then, indicate which player starts first 0 = user, 1 = AI
# Information
This application is a work-in-progress and will be constantly updated at varying intervals of time. This project was created as a means for me to learn more about the minimax descision rule and its use cases for creating artificial intelligences that will always tie or win [solved games.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_game)

# Room for improvement
- Add to the user interface, allowing users to click buttons to indicate which player starts first (player or ai).
- Implement a "restart" feature that allows users to play multiple games without having to restart the program.

# Screenshots
Screenshots of the game will be added shortly.

# Notes
When running the game using a system running macOS, the final moves that cause an end state (win/lose/tie) will not be drawn. This is not the case with systems running Windows 10, and I am currently unsure of the issue.
